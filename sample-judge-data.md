# Judge Application System

The judge application system is fully integrated with Supabase PostgreSQL database. All judge data comes from real applications submitted through the `/apply` form.

## System Overview

✅ **Application Form**: Multi-step form with validation and file upload at `/apply`
✅ **Database Storage**: All applications stored in Supabase PostgreSQL  
✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Review, approve, and reject applications at `/admin`
✅ **Judge Profiles**: Automatic profile generation with unique URLs at `/judges/[slug]`
✅ **API Endpoints**: Complete CRUD operations for judges and applications

## Admin Workflow

1. **Review Applications**: Pending applications appear in admin dashboard
2. **Approve/Reject**: Use admin controls to manage application status  
3. **Create Profiles**: Approved applications automatically generate judge profiles
4. **Manage Judges**: Use "Manage Judges" tab to control featured status and remove judges

No mock or sample data is used - all content comes from real database entries. Submission

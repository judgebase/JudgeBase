perfect, you're now designing the **/host** flow — a private intake + access system for hackathon organizers.

this is how real SaaS platforms work: clean public entry, gated backend, approval flow. you're not just collecting forms, you're building **controlled trust pipes** to your judge database.

**audience**: hackathon organizers looking to request judges

## 🟦 What Happens Next (Info Block)

> This section builds clarity and trust after the form.

**Title:** What Happens After You Submit

* Your request is reviewed by the JudgeBase team.
* If approved, you’ll get a private link to `/judges` with access to our panel.
* You’ll be asked to confirm deliverables for the judges.
* From there, we’ll start shortlisting based on your theme and format.

---

## ⬛ Final CTA

Large bottom bar:

**"Build your panel the right way."**
No scraping. No random invites. Just handpicked talent.
→ *Submit Your Event*

---

## 🛠 backend logic (for now)

* all submissions go into Airtable or Google Sheet via Tally
* you review manually
* you flip a toggle in `/admin` = permission granted
* if `event.status === approved`, that event email gets access to `/judges`

you’ll gate `/judges` behind a simple access check later. for now, it’s manual.

---

want me to:

* design the form in Tailwind?
* create the `/admin` approval toggle system?
* write the `/judges` access gating logic?

say the word. this is your B2B frontend layer done right.

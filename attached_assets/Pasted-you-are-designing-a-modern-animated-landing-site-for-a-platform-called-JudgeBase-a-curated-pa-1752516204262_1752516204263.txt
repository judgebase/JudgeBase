you are designing a modern, animated landing site for a platform called **JudgeBase** — a curated panel of expert judges for hackathons. the site should feel sleek, vibrant, and exclusive — like a mix of **Topmate**, **Notion**, and **Stripe**.

### overall design vibe:
- bold gradients (electric purple, blue, green)
- soft rounded cards, clean spacing
- large type, calm animations, smooth hover effects
- aesthetic should feel premium, trustable, and slightly playful

### fonts:
use modern sans-serif fonts like Inter, Satoshi, or Outfit  
body should be light, airy — make the typography breathe

### animations:
- subtle card lift on hover
- section fade-ins on scroll
- CTA buttons pulse or glow gently

### logo:
use the attached JudgeBase logo (multicolor, pixel-style J)  
stick to that vibe — modern but punchy

### pages required:

1. **Home Page `/`**
   - big title: “be on the panel.”
   - subtext: “we connect serious events with serious judges.”
   - CTA: two large buttons:
     - “i want to judge” → goes to `/apply`
     - “i’m a hackathon looking for judges” → goes to `/host`
   - “trusted by” logo strip (Maximally, MU, Devpost, etc)
   - featured judges (3–4 judge cards pulled dynamically from db)
   - section: “Why JudgeBase?” (3 horizontal cards: curated, async, recognized)
   - footer: logo, discord link, contact

2. **Apply Page `/apply`**
   - application form for new judges
   - fields: name, email, linkedin, experience, judging philosophy, socials, headshot upload
   - on submit, save to PostgreSQL or DB layer
   - show a thank you message, “we’ll reach out if selected.”

3. **Host Page `/host`**
   - simple pitch: “running a hackathon? we provide trusted judges.”
   - form for hackathons to fill:
     - event name, dates, org, number of judges needed, format (async/live)
   - saves to db
   - CTA: “submit your event”

4. **Judge Profile Page `/judges/:slug`**
   - dynamic routing for individual judges
   - layout:
     - avatar, name, role
     - 1-liner bio
     - judging philosophy
     - social links (LinkedIn, X, website)
     - badge strip (e.g. judge of the month, participant fav)
     - events judged (styled as cards)
     - optional “contact me” button

5. **Not a public directory**
   - do **not** add a full judge search or listing
   - only show **featured judges** on homepage
   - individual profiles should be linkable but not browsable via search

6. **CMS Backend or Admin Placeholder**
   - allow the site owner (me) to manually:
     - approve/reject judge applications
     - assign badges
     - edit profile info
   - this can be a simple internal page or JSON edits

### data storage
store all judge applications and hackathon submissions in **PostgreSQL** or any database that works well on Replit. each judge who is approved gets a profile created under `/judges/:slug`.

### bonus ideas
- judge profiles should feel like a mini portfolio
- eventually you could build a leaderboard, but don’t add it now
- blog/articles not needed for now
- seo-friendly structure preferred

### example references (for vibe)
- https://topmate.io/
- https://stripe.com/
- https://read.cv/
- https://notion.so/

build this as a full Replit project. make it aesthetic, modular, and editable later. i’ll be manually uploading judge data at first, so keep things flexible.

hero section:

headline: be on the panel.

subtext: we connect serious events with serious judges.

two buttons:

i want to judge → /apply

i’m a hackathon looking for judges → /host

trust strip (greyscale logos): Maximally, Masters’ Union, Devpost, etc

featured judges (3–4 cards from a featured pool)

show avatar, name, role/title, short line, LinkedIn/X

section: "Why JudgeBase?" → 3 cards (curated, async judging, recognized)

CTA block: “see how Judge Pages work” → /judges/preview

footer: links, discord icon, email

2. Judge Apply Page /apply
form with:

name, email, title/role

judging experience

LinkedIn, X, website

optional photo upload

on submit → save to backend DB (PostgreSQL or Replit DB)

success message: “you’ll hear from us if selected”

3. Hackathon Host Page /host
headline: need judges for your event?

short para: we work with hackathons to place verified judges and mentors.

form:

org name, hackathon name, website

dates

4. Judge Profile Page /judges/:slug
each approved judge gets their own public profile page
layout:

1-liner bio

“Judging Philosophy” block

social links: LinkedIn, X, website

list of badges (manual for now):

judge of the month

participant favorite

rising judge

founder’s pick

hackathons judged (small cards with event name + logo)

optional: “contact me” button → email link or Notion form

🔒 access rules
no full public directory

only featured judges are visible on homepage

individual profiles can be shared via link, not browsed

only admin (me) can approve and publish new judges

data can be stored manually or via DB, I’ll update for now

🧰 functionality
all forms write to backend (can be simple DB for now)

all judge pages are statically routed via slug system

forms should have required validation and show success states

nav bar should stick and shrink on scroll

optimize for SEO with clean meta tags + alt text on avatars

📱 responsiveness
full mobile-first layout

nav becomes hamburger menu

hero text shrinks and buttons stack

judge cards flow to 1-column layout

💡 bonus (if time):
simple admin.js file where I can manually flip judges from “pending” → “approved”

scroll-based section highlights in navbar

custom favicon with JudgeBase logomark

🧭 sample user journey
flow for new judge:

lands on homepage → clicks “i want to judge” → submits /apply form

if selected, we create their /judges/name page manually

they get a sharable link to use on LinkedIn/bio

flow for hackathon:

lands on homepage → clicks “i’m a hackathon looking for judges”

fills out form

I reach out and onboard manually

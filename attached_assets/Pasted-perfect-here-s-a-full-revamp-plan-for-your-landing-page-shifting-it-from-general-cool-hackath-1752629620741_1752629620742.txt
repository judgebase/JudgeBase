perfect. here’s a full **revamp plan for your landing page**, shifting it from general “cool hackathon brand” to a **judge-first platform** while still keeping the vibe and exclusivity.

---

## 🧠 core positioning shift

Old vibe:

> “Maximally-style, Gen Z-coded hackathon ecosystem”

New vibe:

> **“The platform for serious hackathon judges. Trusted by real events. Built for professionals.”**

Your homepage now becomes the public face of JudgeBase — it should:

* speak to judges (your main supply)
* impress hackathon organizers (your demand)
* feel curated, clean, high-end

### 🟨 Why It Matters (3–card layout)

| Card Title            | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vetted Panelists**  | Every judge is manually approved. No fluff, no filler.                          |
| **Async-Ready**       | Most judges evaluate remotely. No timezone headaches.                           |
| **Signal, Not Noise** | This isn’t just a signup list. It’s a high-trust layer for the hackathon space. |

### 🟦 Featured Judges (3–4 Cards)

Pull your top 3–4 judges manually (use dummy data if needed).
Each card includes:

* Photo
* Name + Role (e.g. PM @ Razorpay)
* “Judge of the Month” or other badge
* Link to their `/judges/slug` page
* 1-line judging philosophy (quote style)

---

### 🟧 How It Works (Split Section)

**Left: I want to judge**

* Apply via `/apply`
* Reviewed on 15th of every month
* If selected, you pay a listing fee and get a public profile
* Get invited to real events

**Right: I need judges**

* Submit your event at `/host`
* We review and approve
* If accepted, you get access to our judge list
* You provide certs + letters, we provide panelists

Icons, light animation, clear headings

---

### ⬛ Final CTA Banner

**Headline:**
`you’ve judged before. now do it properly.`

**Subtext:**
Join the fastest-growing judge panel for real events.
→ \[Apply to Join]
→ \[Request Judges]

---

## 🎨 style recommendations

* full white background with floating colored sections (purples/blues)
* big soft type, lots of spacing
* Topmate energy but more B2B
* use logos and judge avatars as primary trust signals
* remove any references to “school hackathons” — this is professional now

---

want me to:

* write the HTML structure for this page?
* design the judge cards in Tailwind or Figma?
* build the hero in responsive code?

you’re 90% there. this revamp will make JudgeBase feel like the real deal.

Hey! I need help editing the static site for judgebase.co. Please implement these updates:

Create a Judge Profile Page:

New static page: judgebase.co/rishulchanana

Follow this structure:

Hero with name, title, and tagline

"About" section

"Judging Philosophy" section

"Experience" section

"Socials" section

Call-to-action button (mailto link to invite)

All content below should be styled cleanly and consistently. Use cards, section spacing, and mobile responsiveness.

Page Content for rishulchanana:

Name: Rishul Chanana
Role: Founder & CEO, Maximally
Tagline: Building India's fastest-growing teen hackathon league
Location: Chandigarh, India
Languages: English, Hindi, Punjabi

About:
Rishul is a 16-year-old dropout-turned-founder from Zirakpur who’s dead serious about one thing: execution. He runs Maximally, India’s first high-stakes hackathon ecosystem designed for teenagers who’d rather build than cram.

He doesn’t do lectures or checkboxes. His events feel more like Red Bull meets YC — fast, chaotic, and real. His past hackathons have brought in thousands of young builders, and he’s landed partnerships with orgs like Masters’ Union to back the movement.

Rishul’s belief is simple: hackathons aren’t events. They’re engines. Engines for discovery, for proof, and for transformation.

Judging Philosophy:

I reward speed, not theory. I care about clarity, not complexity.
The best builds are sharp, raw, and unapologetically weird.

Rishul judges with a “ship-first” lens — he prioritizes MVPs over mockups, originality over polish, and founder energy over fancy slides.

Experience:

Head Judge – CodeQuest (India’s largest school hackathon)

Judge & Mentor – Maximally Startup Makeathon

Advisor – Startup World Tapri

Consultant – PurpleRain TechSafe

Builder – HackSkye (4000+ student event)

Socials:

Call to Action:
Button text: "Invite to Judge"
Link: mailto:team@judgebase.co?subject=Judge%20Invite%20for%20Rishul%20Chanana

Update “Featured Judges” Section

Remove all mock/joke/test entries

Add one real card linking to /rishulchanana with Rishul’s name, role, and CTA

Routing & Navbar Fixes

All judge pages should follow this format: judgebase.co/username

Fix the “Find Judges” page: navbar is missing — add the same navbar from homepage
